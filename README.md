## Inventory Metrics & Safety Stock Calculator

A simple, reusable inventory management tool built with Google Sheets and Google Sheets AI, designed to calculate key inventory metrics and safety stock for a  SKU.

# Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to track inventory health and plan for demand variability using simple formulas. It covers:
Days of Supply – How long current stock will last based on average daily demand.
Inventory Turns – How frequently inventory is cycled or sold over a period.
Safety Stock – A buffer to prevent stockouts during lead time.
Reorder Point – The inventory level at which a new order should be placed.

# Formulas used:

Safety Stock = Z × Std Dev of Demand × √Lead Time
Reorder Point = (Avg Daily Demand × Lead Time) + Safety Stock


# Tools Used:

Google Sheets – For data storage, calculations, and dynamic updates.
Sheets AI – To automate calculations and insights.
