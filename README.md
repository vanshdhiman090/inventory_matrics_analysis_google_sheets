## Inventory Metrics & Safety Stock Calculator

A simple, reusable inventory management tool built with Google Sheets and Google Sheets AI, designed to calculate key inventory metrics and safety stock for a  SKU.

# Project Overview

This project shows how to keep track of inventory and prepare for changes in demand using easy formulas. It includes:
Days of Supply – How many days your current stock will last.
Inventory Turns – How often your stock gets sold and replaced.
Safety Stock – Extra stock to prevent running out during delivery delays.
Reorder Point – The stock level at which you should order more.

### Formulas used:

Safety Stock = Z × Std Dev of Demand × √Lead Time
Reorder Point = (Avg Daily Demand × Lead Time) + Safety Stock


### Tools Used:

Google Sheets – For data storage, calculations, and dynamic updates.
Sheets AI – To automate calculations and insights.
